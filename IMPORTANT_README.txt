The backup folder has an untouched Female and Male animations file, in case anybody needs it for any reason..
DO NOT take the executable out of the root folder!
DO NOT touch the "Resources" folder. It contains the font the application uses (so it loads correctly on your device) and the tutorials, nothing special

If Windows says it's a virus, just open it anyway. I can assure you that this is not a virus, at all. 
I would gain nothing, plus I have no desire to put a virus into a project I'm releasing to people who support me..
(To be honest, I don't even know how to do that.)
